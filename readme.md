Hello! 


Welcome to John's motif-mark code! 

This code is used to identify protein binding motifs in a gene. 

To use this code simply clone this repo and call:

motif-mark-oop.py -f <your_fasta_file.fa> -m <your_motifs_file.txt>

The program will automatically create a file with the same prefix as the filename that was provided. 

For Example: 

This repo has the following files that can be used to generate motif figures. 

Figure_1.fasta
Fig_1_motifs.txt

output can be seen in the Figure_1.png file
